# 🌟 **Customer Churn Prediction**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
Customer churn prediction is a critical task in business intelligence, enabling companies to identify and retain at-risk customers. This project employs a suite of advanced machine learning models to analyze customer data and predict churn with high precision.

The models used include:
- **🧩 Multi-input Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **🔍 Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**
- **⏳ Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) transformers**
- **⚡ Hybrid CNN-Seq2Seq model**

Each architecture plays a unique role in processing and learning from diverse customer attributes such as demographics, usage patterns, payment history, and behavioral trends. This comprehensive approach captures local patterns, intricate relationships, and temporal dependencies in the data, providing a robust and explainable solution to churn prediction.

## 📚 **Detailed Methodology**

### **1. 🧩 Multi-input Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
CNNs are leveraged to extract hierarchical features from structured data. These models effectively capture localized patterns within customer attributes, such as correlations between usage trends and payment history. Convolutional filters applied across the data generate meaningful feature maps that are used for churn prediction.

#### **Mathematical Representation**
```plaintext
Y = ReLU(W * X + b)
```
Where:
- X: Input features
- W: Filter matrix
- b: Bias term
- ReLU introduces non-linearity, enabling the model to learn complex patterns.

### **2. 🔍 Deep Neural Network (DNN)**
DNNs are fully connected networks designed to learn non-linear relationships between customer attributes. By processing input features through multiple hidden layers, DNNs uncover intricate patterns that contribute to churn prediction.

#### **Mathematical Representation**
```plaintext
y = σ(W2(σ(W1x + b1)) + b2)
```
Where:
- W1, W2: Weight matrices for layers
- b1, b2: Bias terms
- σ: Activation function

This enables the model to effectively capture diverse and complex relationships in customer data.

### **3. ⏳ Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer**
Seq2Seq transformers excel in analyzing sequential data. This model captures temporal patterns in customer behavior, such as monthly usage trends and their impact on churn likelihood.

The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of an input sequence, enhancing its ability to model long-term dependencies.

#### **Attention Weights Formula**
```plaintext
α_i = exp(score(q, k_i)) / Σ_j=1^n exp(score(q, k_j))
```
Where:
- q: Query vector
- k_i: Key vector for the i-th input element

The context vector, computed from these weights, summarizes essential sequence information.

### **4. ⚡ Hybrid CNN-Seq2Seq Model**
This hybrid model integrates the strengths of CNNs for extracting localized features and Seq2Seq transformers for analyzing sequential dependencies. The CNN processes customer attributes to generate feature maps, while the Seq2Seq component captures temporal trends and relationships.

#### **Model Output Formula**
```plaintext
y = SoftMax(Whybrid × Seq2Seq(CNN(X)) + bhybrid)
```
Where:
- X: Input feature matrix
- Whybrid, bhybrid: Weight and bias terms

This architecture ensures both local and global patterns are utilized for accurate churn prediction.
